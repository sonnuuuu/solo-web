             <p>
These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us relating to Solo
and your Use of Solo, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral
or written understandings or agreements between the Company and you relating to
Solo and your Use of Solo. The language of these Terms is the English language
only. You hereby irrevocably waive any law applicable to you requiring that these
Terms shall be localized to meet your language (as well as any other localization
requirements), or requiring a delivery or retention of non-electronic records. The
failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of such right or provision
will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of
the Company. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either
party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other
remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If any provision of these Terms is held
invalid and unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of
the Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration Section above or by court of competent
jurisdiction), that provision will be enforceable to the maximum extent permissible
and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. The
Section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or
contractual effect. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended
solely for the benefit of you and the Company and are not intended to confer third
party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity. You may not assign or
transfer your rights under these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our
prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer your rights under
these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. We may freely
assign or transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms without restriction.
Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties,
their successors and permitted assigns. </p>
